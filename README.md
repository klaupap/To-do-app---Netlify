# Doing your best - To Do App

Final project from IronHack Bootcamp.

A simple To-do app with Vue.js that allows users to create an account, record tasks, edit them and mark them as complete. 


### Deployment

Deployment with Netlify

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f5b53bcc-e572-4046-9552-505979315b37/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/leafy-cocada-a28993/deploys)


### Built With

Client: Vue.js, Vite (dev server)
Router: Vue Router
Store: Pinia and Pinia Persist for persistent login
Database as a service: Supabase
UI library: Bootstrap
We’ll also be using Vite as a build tool to compile our code and provide a development server while we work.


This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).


### Project requirements

Have a repo on GitHub
Commit your work at least once a day during the project development time
Your app should be rendered in a browser
Your app should be deployed online using a cloud service such as Netlify
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
Your app should be styled using CSS
Your app should be fully integrated with a Supabase database using all CRUD operations
You should use Vue’s Pinia to fully implement status handling
You should handle any asynchronous operations using Promises or Async/await
You should document the application’s features, configuration and technical specifications within a README file


### Deliverables

The functionality should include:

Authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
A front-end that displays the user’s personal to-do list
An ability to add new tasks
An ability to edit existing tasks
An ability to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
