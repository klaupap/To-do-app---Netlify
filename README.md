# Doing your best - To Do App :coffee:

Final project from IronHack Bootcamp.

A simple To-do app with Vue.js that allows users to create an account, record tasks, edit them and mark them as complete. 


## Deployment :rocket:

Deployment with Netlify

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f5b53bcc-e572-4046-9552-505979315b37/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/doingyourbest/deploys)


## Built With :wrench:

* Client: Vue.js, Vite (dev server)
* Router: Vue Router
* Store: Pinia and Pinia Persist for persistent login
* Database as a service: Supabase
* UI library: Bootstrap
* Build tool to compile our code and provide a development server while we work: Vite


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Project requirements :paperclip:

* Have a repo on GitHub
* Commit your work at least once a day during the project development time
* Your app should be rendered in a browser
* Your app should be deployed online using a cloud service such as Netlify
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
* Your app should be styled using CSS
* Your app should be fully integrated with a Supabase database using all CRUD operations
* You should use Vue’s Pinia to fully implement status handling
* You should handle any asynchronous operations using Promises or Async/await
* You should document the application’s features, configuration and technical specifications within a README file


## Deliverables :open_file_folder:

The functionality should include:

* Authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out)
* A front-end that displays the user’s personal to-do list
* An ability to add new tasks
* An ability to edit existing tasks
* An ability to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
* An ability to delete existing tasks
* A store and a database that your app can call data from
